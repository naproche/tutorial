# Fractional Arithmetic (Project)

We propose that students develop, in the theory developed so far, the
usual arithmetical laws for fractions of the form 
\\( \frac{x}{y} \\) where \\(x,y\\) are numbers and $y \neq 0$.
One can choose whether to treat \\( \frac{x}{y} \\) as an
*abbreviation* for `x \* (1/y)` or to *define* it accordingy.
One could denote fractions by `x // y` in the `.ftl` style, or
one could switch to the LaTeX style and use `\frac{x}{y}`. (Note
that a single slash ` / ` has already been used for the inverse and
lead to ambiguities when encountering `1 / x`.)

After fixing notation, state and prove lemmas like
\\( \frac{a}{b} \* \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a\*c}{b\*d} \\), 
\\( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \dots \\),
\\( \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \dots \\), etc.
