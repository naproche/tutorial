function as name of specific objects or sets of objects:
"*number*", "*number*", "*triangle*", "*triangle*", ...;
- *verbs* convey actions, occurrences or states of being; as
mathematics is mainly static, the static use is prominent:
"f *vanishes*", "m *divides* n", ... ;
- *adjectives* are used to modify nouns: "*positive* number", 
"*complex* root", ...;
- similarly *adverbs* are used to modify verbs: "f vanishes 
*everywhere*";
- *pronouns* are abbreviations for nouns or noun phrases; 
since identifying the referent of a pronoun may be ambiguous
("A farmer has a donkey. He beats it."), mathematics often uses
(sambolic) *variables* and *constants* to denote nouns;
- *prepositions* are frequently used in mathematics: "an element
*of* x", "x lies above y", ...;
- in mathematics, *conjunctions* like "and" and "or" have exact
logical meanings;
